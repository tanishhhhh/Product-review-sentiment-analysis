# 🛍️ Product Review Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to determine their sentiment — positive, negative, or neutral. The aim is to help businesses and platforms better understand customer feedback at scale.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Classify the sentiment of product reviews.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch, Pandas, NLTK / SpaCy, Matplotlib / Seaborn.
- **Dataset**: Public product reviews dataset (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart, or custom scraped data).
- **Model(s)**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Deep Learning (LSTM/BERT).

## 🧠 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (stopword removal, tokenization, lemmatization)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations
- Feature engineering using TF-IDF or word embeddings
- Sentiment classification using ML/DL models
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- (Optional) Deployment as a web app using Flask or Streamlit


## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
```

## Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Launch the app
```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```
## 📊 Results
Accuracy: ~XX% (to be updated after training)

Precision / Recall / F1: Evaluated on test set using classification report

Visualizations and confusion matrix available in EDA notebook

## 🚀 Future Work
Expand to multilingual reviews

Integrate with real-time review streams

Improve model performance using pre-trained transformers like BERT or DistilBERT

Deploy as a web app or API service
